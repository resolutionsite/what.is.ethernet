Ethernet is a traditional technology used to connect devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), enabling them to communicate with each other through a protocol (a set of rules or a common network language).

Ethernet describes how network devices format and transmit data so that other devices on the same LAN or campus network segment can identify, receive, and process information. An Ethernet cable is the physical, enclosed wiring over which data passes.

## Why Use Ethernet?

Ethernet is used to connect devices in the network and is still a popular form of network connection. For local networks used by specific organizations (such as corporate offices, school campuses, and hospitals), Ethernet is used for its high speed, security, and reliability.

Ethernet was initially popular because of its low price. With the development of network technology, Ethernet can continuously develop and provide higher performance levels, while maintaining backward compatibility, thus ensuring the continued popularity of Ethernet.
